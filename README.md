This application had three main focus objectives:</p>
<ul>

    -Shopping List: 
	  Section to save your expenses.
	    In this Activity (Empty Views Activity), each user had a field to write the items name, and save it on the list. Then, it would show bellow(recycle view list). Also, it had a field to remove the expense, in which users indicated the items id to remove (auto-sort implemented as well).
  </li>
  <li>
    -To-Do List: 
	  To save your To-Do list app.
	    In this Activity (Fullscreen Views Activity, activity on horizontal), each usar could click a button which lead to show two fields: to add task, and remove task (same principle as Shopping List, one adds task and the other removes expense, with auto-increment). After adding, it would show the task on screen. It also had, a clock on top-left side, and a batery showcase, which show the percentage and it would replace the image from time, depending on how much batery a users had.
  </li>
