<h2>ShoppingToDoPost</h2>

<p>Shopping-ToDo-Post was an application developed throught an exercise in the course Web and Mobile Developement in Cesae Porto.
This application had three main focus objectives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    -Shopping List: 
	  Section to save your expenses.
	    In this Activity (Empty Views Activity), each user had a field to write the items name, and save it on the list. Then, it would show bellow(recycle view list). Also, it had a field to remove the expense, in which users indicated the items id to remove (auto-sort implemented as well).
  </li>
  <li>
    -To-Do List: 
	  To save your To-Do list app.
	    In this Activity (Fullscreen Views Activity, activity on horizontal), each usar could click a button which lead to show two fields: to add task, and remove task (same principle as Shopping List, one adds task and the other removes expense, with auto-increment). After adding, it would show the task on screen. It also had, a clock on top-left side, and a batery showcase, which show the percentage and it would replace the image from time, depending on how much batery a users had.
  </li>

  <li>
    -Post Layout: 
	  To write post and scroll through them.
	    Users had a field to write their name, email, title of post and text content. After submiting the post, it would save in our Recycle View, and it would show bellow (you could also scroll throw it).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding specifications, this application had five activities, two recycle views (two adapters), three models, and some icons from the Android studio.</p>
